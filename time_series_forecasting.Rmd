# Time Series Forecasting

## The Importance of Forecasting

- Governments forecast unemployment rates, interest rates, and expected revenues from income taxes for policy purposes   
- Marketing executives forecast demand, sales, and consumer preferences for strategic planning   
- College administrators forecast enrollments to plan for facilities and for faculty recruitment   
- Retail stores forecast demand to control inventory levels, hire employees and provide training

## Common Approaches to Forecasting

- Qualitative forecasting methods   
    - Used when historical data are unavailable   
    - Considered highly subjective and judgmental
- Quantitative forecasting methods   
    - Time series or Causal   
    - Use past data to predict future values   

## Time-Series Data

- Numerical data obtained at regular time intervals   
- The time intervals can be annually, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily, hourly, etc.  
```{r, echo=FALSE}
a <- tibble("Sales:")
b <- tibble(75.3)
c <- tibble(74.2)
d <- tibble(78.5)
e <- tibble(79.7)
f <- tibble(80.2)
g <- bind_cols(a,b,c,d,e,f)
kable(g, caption = "Example", col.names = c("Years:", 2005, 2006,2007, 2008, 2009))
Year <- tibble(c(2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009))
Sales <- tibble(c(75.3,74.2,78.5,79.7,80.2))
yrs <- bind_cols(Year, Sales)
```

## Time-Series Plot   

- A time-series plot is a two-dimensional plot of time series data   
    - the vertical axis measures the variable of interest  
- the horizontal axis corresponds to the time periods

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(yrs, aes(x=Year, y=Sales)) + geom_line() +ylim(60, 90) + ggtitle("Time Series Data") + geom_point() + theme_tufte() + geom_rug()
```


## Time-Series Components  

- Trend Component  
    - Overall, persistent, long-term movement   
- Seasonal Component     
    - Regular periodic fluctuations, usually within a 12-month period  

- Cyclical Component  
    - Repeating swings or movements over more than one year
- Irregular Component   
    - Repeating swings or movements over more than one year  
Erratic or residual fluctuations

## Trend Component  

- Long-run increase or decrease over time (overall upward or downward movement)  
- Data taken over a long period of time  
- Trend can be upward or downward  
- Trend can be linear or non-linear  


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Time <- tibble(c(2005,2006, 2007, 2008,2009,2010))
Sales <- tibble(c(50, 70,60,75,65,80))
a <- bind_cols(Time, Sales)

ggplot(a, aes(x=Time, y=Sales)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE) + theme_tufte() + geom_rug()

```

## Seasonal Component

- Short-term regular wave-like patterns   
- Observed within 1 year   
- Often monthly or quarterly
Sales  

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Time <- tibble((c("01Q4", "02Q1", "02Q2", "02Q3", "02Q4", "03Q1", "03Q2", "03Q3", "03Q4")))
Sales <- tibble(c(50.1,65.1,60.1,70.1,62.1,75.1,68.1,77.1,70.1))
a <- bind_cols(Time, Sales)
colnames(a) <- c("Time", "Sales")
a$Time <- factor(a$Time)
ggplot(a, aes(x=Time, y=Sales)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + theme_tufte() + geom_rug()
```

## Cyclical Component

- Long-term wave-like patterns  
- Regularly occur but may vary in length  
- Often measured peak to peak or trough to trough  

## Irregular Component  

- Unpredictable, random, “residual” fluctuations  
- Due to random variations of Nature  
- Accidents or unusual events  
- “Noise” in the time series  

## Does Your Time Series Have A Trend Component?


- A time-series plot should help you to answer this question.  

- Often it helps if you “smooth” the time-series data to help answer this question.  


- Two popular smoothing methods are moving averages and exponential smoothing.

## Smoothing Methods

- Moving Averages  
    - Calculate moving averages to get an overall impression of the pattern of movement over time  
    - Averages of consecutive time-series values for a chosen period of length L.  


- Exponential Smoothing   
    - A weighted moving average

## Moving Averages  

- Used for smoothing  
- A series of arithmetic means over time  
- Result dependent upon choice of L (length of period for computing means)  
- Last moving average of length L can be extrapolated one period into future for a short term forecast  
- Examples:    
    - For a 5 year moving average, L = 5  
    - For a 7 year moving average, L = 7  
    - Etc.  
    
- Example: Five-year moving average 

    - First average: $MA(5)=\frac{Y_1+Y_2+Y_3+Y_4+Y_5}{5}$






    - Second average:$MA(5)=\frac{Y_2+Y_3+Y_4+Y_5+Y_6}{5}$

    - etc.
- The 5-year moving average smoothes the data and makes it easier to see the underlying trend   

## Exponential Smoothing  

- Used for smoothing and short term forecasting (one period into the future)  


- A weighted moving average  
    - Weights decline exponentially  
    - Most recent observation is given the highest weight   
    
    



- The weight (smoothing coefficient) is W  
    - Subjectively chosen  
    - Ranges from 0 to 1  
    - Smaller W gives more smoothing, larger W gives less smoothing  
- The weight is:  
    - Close to 0 for smoothing out unwanted cyclical and irregular components  
    - Close to 1 for forecasting  

## Exponential Smoothing Model



- $E_1=Y_1$  
- $E_i=WE_i+ (1-W)E_{i-1}$ 
  For i = 2, 3, 4, …
  where:
	$Ei$ = exponentially smoothed value for period i  
	$E_{i-1}$ = exponentially smoothed value already
		 computed for period i - 1  
	 $Y_i$ = observed value in period i  
	 W = weight (smoothing coefficient), 0 < W < 1

## Forecasting Time Period i + 1  

   The smoothed value in the current period (i) is used as the forecast value for next period (i + 1) :  
- $\hat{Y_{i+1}}= E_i$


## There Are Three Popular Methods For Trend-Based Forecasting

- Linear Trends   
    - Linear Trend Model  

- Non Linear Trends   
    - Quadratic Trend Model   
    - Exponential Trend Forecasting   


## Linear Trend Forecasting  

Estimate a trend line using regression analysis
Use time (X) as the independent variable:  

  - $\hat{Y}=b_0+b_1X$

In least squares linear, non-linear, and
exponential modeling, time periods are
numbered starting with 0 and increasing
by 1 for each time period.

## Nonlinear Trend Forecasting   

- A nonlinear regression model can be used when the time series exhibits a nonlinear trend  


- Compare adj. $r^2$ and standard error to that of linear model to see if this is an improvement



## Choosing A Forecasting Model

- Perform a residual analysis   
    - Eliminate a model that shows a pattern or trend   
- Measure magnitude of residual error using squared differences and select the model with the smallest value  
- Measure magnitude of residual error using absolute differences and select the model with the smallest value  
- Use simplest model  
    - Principle of parsimony  
    
## Principal of Parsimony  

- Suppose two or more models provide a good fit for the data   
- Select the simplest model   

## Pitfalls in Time-Series Analysis   

- Assuming the mechanism that governs the time series behavior in the past will still hold in the future   
- Using mechanical extrapolation of the trend to forecast the future without considering personal judgments, business experiences, changing technologies, and habits, etc.
